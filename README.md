# Statistical-Machine-Learning-Implementations
This repository is a collection of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms implemented entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy.

The goal of this project was to move beyond "black-box" library calls (like scikit-learn) and reconstruct the mathematical engines driving these models. Each implementation focuses on:

Vectorization: replacing loops with matrix operations for performance.

Optimization: deriving manual gradients and handling convex optimization.

Numerical Stability: handling underflow/overflow in probabilistic models.
